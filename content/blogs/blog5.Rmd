title: About me
---

My name is Shreya and I am originally from India. I moved to Boston for college and work. I completed my Bachelors of Science in Business Administration from Northeastern University. After college I worked as a Fund Accounting Analyst at J.P. Morgan for 2 years. I am currently a student at London Business School, pursuing my Masters in Financial Analysis degree. After graduating in 2021, I wish to work as an Investment Banker in London.
I love traveling and exploring new places. My hobbies also include playing the piano, trying new restaurants and reading!
